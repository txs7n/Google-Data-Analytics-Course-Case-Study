# Google-Data-Analytics-Course-Case-Study

## Overview
This case study was one of the two capstone projects required to complete the Google Data Analysis Course.
I was tasked with analysing bike riding data for a period of 12 months in a bid to understand the riding behaviour of both members and casual riders for a hypothetical company - Cyclistic.
